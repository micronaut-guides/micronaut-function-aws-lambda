Lets describe the microservices you are going to build through the tutorial.

* `vies-vat-validator` - A Function which you will build with Micronaut and deploy to https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/[AWS Lambda].

* `invoice` - A microservice which  exposes an endpoint to check the Value Added Tax (VAT) which should apply to an invoice. It consumes the `vies-vat-validator` function to ensure the VAT number is valid.

The next diagram illustrates the flow:
